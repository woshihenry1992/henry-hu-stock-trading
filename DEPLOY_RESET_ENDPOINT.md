# 🚀 **Deploy Reset Endpoint for Data Clearing**

## **📋 What Changed:**

I've temporarily enabled the database reset endpoint to allow you to clear all production data. This is a **temporary change** for your data clearing operation.

## **🔧 Deployment Required:**

You need to deploy the updated `backend/server.js` to Render:

### **Option 1: Manual Deploy (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your backend service
3. Go to "Settings" → "Build & Deploy"
4. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
5. Wait for deployment to complete

### **Option 2: Git Push (if you have git setup)**
```bash
git add backend/server.js
git commit -m "Temporarily enable reset endpoint for data clearing"
git push origin main
```

## **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is Temporary**

The reset endpoint is now enabled but will be **disabled again** after you clear your data. This is for your safety.

## **🎯 After Deployment:**

Once deployed, you can clear all data using:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://henry-hu-stock-trading.onrender.com/api/admin/reset-database?confirm=RESET_ALL_DATA_CONFIRM"
```

## **📊 What Will Happen:**

1. **All transactions** will be deleted
2. **All share lots** will be deleted  
3. **All stocks** will be deleted
4. **All users** will be deleted (except admin)
5. **Your admin account** will be preserved

## **🛡️ Safety Features:**

- ✅ **Confirmation required** (RESET_ALL_DATA_CONFIRM)
- ✅ **Your backups are safe** (local files)
- ✅ **Admin account preserved** (user ID 1)
- ✅ **Database structure intact** (tables remain)

## **🚨 After Data Clearing:**

**I will immediately disable this endpoint again** to restore your data protection measures.
